Reimplementation of my [chess-htmx](https://github.com/Qinbeans/chess-htmx) project in Gleam. The original project was written in Go and used the [htmx](https://htmx.org/) library to create a web-based chess game.

```sh
gleam add chess_glm
```
```gleam
import chess_glm

pub fn main() {
  // TODO: An example of the project in use
}
```

Further documentation can be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/chess_glm>.

## Development

```sh
gleam run   # Run the project
gleam test  # Run the tests
gleam shell # Run an Erlang shell
```
